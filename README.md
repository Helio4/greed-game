# Greed
A small rogue-lite where the goal is to collect as much money as possible while surviving to endless waves of enemies that get progressively stronger.</br>
The cave you play in is generated randomly, so every playthrough is different!</br></br>

This is my first game made using Unity. I made it in collaboration with a classmate for an asigment, and we scored a solid 9 out of 10.
